                <h1>What Is No-Nonsense Javascript?</h1>
                <p>Front-end development these days is a mess:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Over-dependence on third-party code</li>
                        <li>Huge frameworks for the tiniest of apps</li>
                        <li>Thousands of npm modules for a simple project</li>
                        <li>Compromised dependencies breaking web apps across the globe</li>
                        <li>Taking 25 seconds to compile down to an interpreted language</li>
                        <li>...Compiling down to an interpreted language in the first place</li>
                    </ul>

                <p>Saying "no-nonsense Javascript" seems like a contradiction.</p>

                <p>Yes, all of these things exist for a reason. There have been some dark days in Javascript's history. There's definitely a trend toward more modular, maintainable code.</p>
                    
                <p>And no doubt, sometimes it's worth it. These tools can help large teams maintain code quality for developers with varying degrees of experience. They're also great for quick prototyping, or beginners wanting to learn the basics.</p>

                <p>Sometimes they're necessary to prevent cowboy coders from breaking all the rules and creating chaos.</p>

                <p>But what if you're a competent developer who knows how to architect and write maintainable code? Your code and productivity suffer because you're working around something you don't really need.</p>

                <p>Because in the end, these things are all just layers on top of Javascript.</p>

                <p>The code that everything compiles to, and the code that actually gets run by the browser, is <em>Javascript</em>.</p>

                <p>And the more Javascript that runs, the more CPU cycles and RAM your app consumes... and the more complicated your codebase is, reducing the likelihood that you understand everything happening under the hood.</p>

                <p>What if you could write Javascript in such a way that all these extra layers were unnecessary?</p>

                <p><em><strong>Ask yourself:</strong></em></p>

                <ul>
                    <li>As a competent Javascript developer, are you frustrated by the limitations imposed by modern front-end development?</li>
                    <li>Are you continually annoyed by slow and buggy web apps, but feel powerless to do anything about it?</li>
                    <li>Are performance, quick iterations, and fully understanding your codebase important to you?</li>
                    <li>If you could eliminate all the build times and excess dependencies by changing your coding style, would you do it?</li>
                </ul>

                <p>If so, this site is for you.</p>
